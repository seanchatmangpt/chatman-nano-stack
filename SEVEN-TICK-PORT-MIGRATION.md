## Operational Migration

### Complete Operational Sequence

#### Phase 1: Specification (Genesis of Intent)
```bash
# Define domain semantics
echo "Patient must have exactly one name" > spec/shapes.ttl
echo "Find high-risk patients" > spec/queries.sparql

# Let the system reason the implementation
make
```

#### Phase 2: Reasoning (Act of Creation)
```bash
# AOT Reasoner transforms specification to optimized C code
./aot_compiler_production.py ontology.ttl shapes.ttl queries.sparql
# Generates: validate_patient_shape(), find_high_risk_patients()
```

#### Phase 3: Validation (Conscience)
```bash
# Gatekeeper validates generated artifacts
./gatekeeper --validate
# Ensures: ≤7 cycles P95, Six Sigma quality, throughput requirements
```

#### Phase 4: Execution (Purpose Manifested)
```bash
# Execute the solution
./healthcare_analyzer --find-high-risk
# Processes millions of nodes per second with telemetry
```

#### Phase 5: Feedback (Consciousness)
```bash
# System observes itself and evolves
./telemetry_analyzer --report
# Triggers optimization if P95 > 7 cycles
```

### System Commands

#### Core Commands
```bash
make                    # Invoke AOT Reasoner
./gatekeeper --validate # Run quality validation
./application --telemetry # Run with full observability
./benchmark --real      # Run honest performance tests
```

#### Domain-Specific Commands
```bash
./healthcare_analyzer    # Process mining and patient analysis
./ecommerce_analyzer     # Order fulfillment optimization
./config_generator       # AOT-driven configuration generation
python demo_python_integration.py # Ecosystem integration
```
