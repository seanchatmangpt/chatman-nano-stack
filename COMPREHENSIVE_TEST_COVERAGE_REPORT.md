## 🎭 BDD Scenario Details

### Feature: TTL to Ash.Reactor Transformation
```gherkin
Scenario: Successfully transform a simple TTL ontology
  Given a valid TTL ontology with classes and properties
  When I transform the TTL using TTLAshReactorTransformer  
  Then it should generate Ash resources
  And it should generate Ash.Reactor workflows
  And it should create compilable Elixir code
```

### Feature: AI Hyper Intelligence Swarm
```gherkin
Scenario: Detect and fix missing input connections
  Given a reactor step with missing inputs
  When the AI swarm analyzes the system
  Then it should identify the missing connection
  And it should create a self-healing connection
```

### Feature: Security Defense System
```gherkin
Scenario: Deploy security defenses against vulnerabilities
  Given identified security vulnerabilities
  When security defenses are deployed  
  Then all vulnerabilities should be mitigated
```
