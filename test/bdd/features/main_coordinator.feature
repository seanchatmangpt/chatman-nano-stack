Feature: Main Coordinator Reactor Workflow
  As a system coordinator
  I want to orchestrate different operations
  So that I can process signals, collect telemetry, and coordinate swarms

  Background:
    Given the Main Coordinator Reactor is initialized
    And TTL constraints are set to 5000ms

  @positive @happy_path
  Scenario: Successfully process signals operation
    Given I have an operation "process_signals"
    And I have data with signal_count of 10
    When I run the Main Coordinator
    Then the operation should be validated as valid
    And the context should be initialized with correct TTL
    And the operation should execute successfully
    And the result should show 10 signals processed
    And the execution should be TTL compliant

  @positive @happy_path
  Scenario: Successfully collect telemetry operation
    Given I have an operation "collect_telemetry"
    And I have data with metrics ["cpu", "memory", "latency"]
    When I run the Main Coordinator
    Then the operation should be validated as valid
    And the operation should execute successfully
    And the result should show 3 metrics collected
    And the execution should be TTL compliant

  @positive @happy_path
  Scenario: Successfully coordinate swarm operation
    Given I have an operation "coordinate_swarm"
    And I have data with agent_count of 5
    When I run the Main Coordinator
    Then the operation should be validated as valid
    And the operation should execute successfully
    And the result should show 5 agents coordinated
    And the execution should be TTL compliant

  @negative @error_handling
  Scenario: Invalid operation handling
    Given I have an operation "invalid_operation"
    And I have empty data
    When I run the Main Coordinator
    Then the operation validation should fail
    And the error should contain "Invalid operation: invalid_operation"

  @negative @ttl_violation
  Scenario: TTL constraint violation
    Given I have an operation "process_signals"
    And I have data with signal_count of 1000
    And TTL constraints are set to 1ms
    When I run the Main Coordinator
    Then the operation should execute
    But the TTL compliance check should fail
    And the error should contain "TTL exceeded"

  @edge_case
  Scenario: Empty data handling
    Given I have an operation "process_signals"
    And I have empty data
    When I run the Main Coordinator
    Then the operation should execute successfully
    And the result should show 0 signals processed

  @edge_case
  Scenario: Missing TTL constraints
    Given I have an operation "collect_telemetry"
    And I have data with metrics ["test"]
    And no TTL constraints are specified
    When I run the Main Coordinator
    Then the default TTL of 5000ms should be used
    And the operation should execute successfully
