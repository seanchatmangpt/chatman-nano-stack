### Latency Requirements (REAL)
| Component | Current CNS | Forex Requirement | Gap |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Market Data** | N/A (mock) | <100μs | Missing entirely |
| **Risk Check** | Simulated | <50μs | No real risk system |
| **Order Routing** | N/A | <200μs | No broker connectivity |
| **End-to-End** | 4.76ns (fake) | <1ms (real) | Measuring wrong thing |

### Infrastructure Stack

// REAL FOREX SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
typedef struct forex_engine {
    fix_session_t* broker_sessions[MAX_BROKERS];
    market_data_t* data_feeds[MAX_FEEDS];
    risk_engine_t* risk_manager;
    position_manager_t* positions;
    strategy_engine_t* strategies[MAX_STRATEGIES];
    regulatory_reporter_t* compliance;
} forex_engine_t;

// NOT THIS DEMO STUFF:
typedef struct bitactor_engine {
    signal_t signals[4096];  // Meaningless for forex
    // Missing: brokers, risk, positions, compliance
} bitactor_engine_t;
```

## 🎯 CURRENT CNS VS FOREX REALITY

```mermaid
pie title "CNS Completion for Forex Trading"
    "Complete (Demo)" : 5
    "Missing (Production)" : 95
```

### What CNS Has (5%)
- ✅ Fast signal processing (irrelevant for forex)
- ✅ Low-level performance (wrong metrics)
- ✅ Test framework (not trading framework)

### What CNS Needs (95%)
- ❌ Prime broker connectivity
- ❌ Market data feeds
- ❌ Risk management system
- ❌ Regulatory compliance
- ❌ Position management
- ❌ Order management
- ❌ P&L calculation
- ❌ Trading strategies
- ❌ Capital allocation
- ❌ Client management

## 🚨 BRUTAL CONCLUSION

**Current CNS**: Academic exercise masquerading as trading system
**Forex Reality**: $100M+ capital, 50+ person team, 3+ years development

### Next Steps
1. **Stop claiming production-ready** for forex
2. **Raise serious capital** ($50M+ Series A)
3. **Hire forex professionals** (not just engineers)
4. **Build real trading infrastructure** (not just fast demos)
5. **Get regulatory licenses** (UK FCA, US CFTC, etc.)

**The gap is not 20%. The gap is 2000%.**

CNS is a impressive low-latency demo. But forex trading requires business infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and massive capital - none of which exist in the current system.
