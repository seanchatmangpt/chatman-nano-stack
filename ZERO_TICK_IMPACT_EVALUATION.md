## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Pre-Zero-Tick Challenges:
1. **Wasteful Processing**: 80% of signals were non-impactful but consumed full tick budget
2. **Throughput Bottleneck**: System limited by processing trivial signals
3. **Resource Inefficiency**: CPU cycles wasted on heartbeat and low-confidence signals
4. **Scalability Limits**: Could not efficiently handle high-frequency signal volumes
5. **Cost Inefficiency**: Expensive hardware underutilized for trivial operations

### Zero-Tick Solution:
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Detect and bypass trivial signals at ingress
- **Compiler Optimization**: Identify zero-tick eligible rules during compilation
- **Runtime Bypass**: Skip execution entirely for non-impactful operations
- **Resource Reallocation**: Redirect saved cycles to meaningful computation

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Impact

### 1. **Compiler Layer Enhancements**

#### Before Zero-Tick:
```python
# All rules processed identically
class IRInstruction:
    def __init__(self, opcode, operands):
        self.tick_cost = 8  # Fixed 8-tick budget
```

#### After Zero-Tick:
```python
# Intelligent tick cost assignment
class IRInstruction:
    def __init__(self, opcode, operands, zero_tick=False):
        self.tick_cost = 0 if zero_tick else 8
        self.zero_tick = zero_tick
```

**Impact**: Compiler now generates optimized bytecode with zero-tick annotations.

### 2. **Runtime Optimization**

#### Before Zero-Tick:
```c
// All signals processed identically
void bitactor_tick(bitactor_t* ba) {
    // Always consume 2-4 cycles
    process_signal(ba->current_signal);
}
```

#### After Zero-Tick:
```c
// Intelligent signal processing
void bitactor_tick(bitactor_t* ba) {
    if (signal_is_trivially_skippable(ba->current_signal)) {
        return;  // 0 cycles consumed
    }
    process_signal(ba->current_signal);  // 2-4 cycles only when needed
}
```

**Impact**: Runtime bypasses trivial signals entirely, achieving true zero-cycle execution.

### 3. **Signal Classification Algorithm**

```c
// Signal classification logic
inline bool signal_is_trivially_skippable(const signal_t* sig) {
    return (sig->type == SIG_HEARTBEAT) ||
           (sig->confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD) ||
           (sig->impact_score < IMPACT_THRESHOLD) ||
           (sig->source_credibility < CREDIBILITY_THRESHOLD) ||
           (sig->duplicate_flag == true);
}
```

**Efficiency**: O(1) constant-time classification with bit-mask operations.
