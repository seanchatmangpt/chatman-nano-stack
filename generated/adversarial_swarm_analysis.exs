  ADVERSARIAL FINDINGS - What DOESN'T Work:
  
  1. ISOLATED EXECUTION: Each component runs alone, no swarm intelligence
  2. NO FEEDBACK LOOPS: Performance results don't improve next generation
  3. SEQUENTIAL BOTTLENECK: Projects process one at a time
  4. STATIC GENERATION: No learning from successful patterns
  5. DISCONNECTED TOOLS: Native bridges don't talk to claude-flow
  6. WASTED METRICS: OTEL data collected but not used for optimization
  7. NO MEMORY: Each run starts from scratch, no accumulated knowledge
