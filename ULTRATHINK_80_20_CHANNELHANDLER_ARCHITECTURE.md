## 🔀 Routing Patterns

### Stage-Specific Routing
```elixir
# Ontology Stage
scope "ontology:" do
  plug &ensure_pipeline_active/4
  
  event "create", OntologyHandler, :create
  event "validate", OntologyHandler, :validate
  event "transform", OntologyHandler, :transform
  
  delegate OntologyHandler
end

# BitActor Distributed Coordination
scope "bitactor:" do
  plug &ensure_distributed_ready/4
  
  event "spawn", BitActorHandler, :spawn_actors
  event "mesh:*", BitActorHandler, :handle_mesh
  
  handle "actor:*", fn payload, %{splat: [actor_type]}, socket ->
    BitActorHandler.route_to_actor(actor_type, payload, socket)
  end
end

# Reactor Workflows with Real-time Steps
scope "reactor:" do
  event "workflow:execute", ReactorHandler, :execute_workflow
  event "steps:*", ReactorHandler, :handle_steps
  
  handle "step:notify", fn payload, _bindings, socket ->
    broadcast_step_notification(socket, payload)
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

## 🔔 Multi-Channel Notifications

### Notification Flow
```
Event Trigger → NotificationBroadcaster → Multiple Channels
                                       ├── WebSocket (UI Updates)
                                       ├── PubSub (Internal)
                                       ├── K8s Events (Cluster)
                                       ├── Webhooks (External)
                                       ├── BitActor (Distributed)
                                       ├── GenServer (Processes)
                                       └── Nuxt (Frontend)
```

### Channel Configurations
| Channel | Latency | Use Case | Topic Pattern |
|---------|---------|----------|---------------|
| WebSocket | <50ms | Real-time UI | `ws:pipeline:{id}` |
| PubSub | <25ms | Internal messaging | `pubsub:stage:{stage}` |
| K8s Events | <200ms | Cluster integration | `k8s:events` |
| Webhooks | <500ms | External systems | `webhooks:pipeline:{id}` |
| BitActor | <100ms | Distributed coordination | `bitactor:mesh` |
| Nuxt Real-time | <75ms | Frontend (NO TypeScript) | `nuxt:realtime` |

## 🔌 Plug Architecture

### Security & Validation Layer
```elixir
# Global authentication for all channels
plug EnsureAuthenticated
plug TrackMetrics

# Stage-specific authorization
scope "reactor:" do
  plug &check_workflow_permissions/4
  event "workflow:execute", ReactorHandler, :execute_workflow
end

# Resource-specific validation
scope "bitactor:" do
  plug &ensure_distributed_ready/4
  plug &check_actor_capacity/4
  event "spawn", BitActorHandler, :spawn_actors
end
```

### Plug Functions
- **EnsureAuthenticated**: User validation across all channels
- **TrackMetrics**: Performance monitoring with telemetry
- **ValidatePayload**: Schema validation for event data
- **CheckPermission**: Fine-grained authorization per action
- **EnsureDistributed**: BitActor node connectivity validation
- **ValidateWorkflow**: Reactor workflow specification validation

---

## 🎭 BitActor Coordination

### Actor Types & Routing
```elixir
# Route messages to specific actor types
handle "actor:*", fn payload, %{splat: [actor_type]}, socket ->
  case actor_type do
    "coordinator" -> route_to_coordinator(payload, socket)
    "monitor" -> route_to_monitor(payload, socket)
    "router" -> route_to_router(payload, socket)
    "metrics" -> route_to_metrics(payload, socket)
    "error_handler" -> route_to_error_handler(payload, socket)
  end
end

# Mesh network operations
scope "bitactor:" do
  event "mesh:join", BitActorHandler, :handle_mesh
  event "mesh:leave", BitActorHandler, :handle_mesh
  event "mesh:status", BitActorHandler, :handle_mesh
  event "mesh:broadcast", BitActorHandler, :handle_mesh
end
```

---

## ⚛️ Reactor Workflow Execution

### Step-by-Step Notifications
```elixir
# Real-time step monitoring
def execute_workflow(payload, _bindings, socket) do
  case WorkflowEngine.execute(workflow, options) do
    {:ok, execution_pid} ->
      # Monitor execution with real-time step notifications
      WorkflowMonitor.subscribe_to_steps(execution_pid, socket.channel_pid)
      
      # Broadcast workflow started
      NotificationBroadcaster.broadcast_stage_event(socket, "reactor:workflow_started", %{
        workflow_id: workflow.id,
        execution_id: execution_pid,
        total_steps: length(workflow.steps)
      })
  end
end

# Handle step events
def handle_steps(payload, %{splat: [step_event]}, socket) do
  case step_event do
    "started" -> handle_step_started(payload, socket)
    "completed" -> handle_step_completed(payload, socket)
    "failed" -> handle_step_failed(payload, socket)
    "retry" -> handle_step_retry(payload, socket)
  end
end
```

---

## 🔄 Pipeline Flow

### Complete Stage Flow with Notifications
```
1. ontology:create  → TypedOntology generation     → Broadcast creation
2. turtle:generate  → TTL transformation          → Broadcast validation  
3. dspy:convert     → DSPy signature conversion   → Broadcast conversion
4. bitactor:spawn   → Distributed actor setup     → Broadcast coordination
5. erlang:generate  → OTP code generation         → Broadcast compilation
6. ash:create       → Resource creation           → Broadcast resources
7. reactor:execute  → Workflow execution           → Broadcast steps
8. k8s:deploy       → Container deployment        → Broadcast deployment
```

### Real-time Progress Updates
- Each stage broadcasts start/progress/completion events
- Multi-channel delivery ensures comprehensive visibility
- WebSocket provides instant UI updates
- K8s events integrate with cluster monitoring
- BitActor mesh coordinates distributed operations
