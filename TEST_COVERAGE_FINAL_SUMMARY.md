### 🎭 BDD Scenario Validation

All critical user scenarios are covered:

```gherkin
Feature: Complete AI Swarm Functionality
  Scenario: Fix missing input connections
    Given a reactor step with missing inputs (update_author_post_count)
    When the AI swarm analyzes the system
    Then it should create proper input connections
    And the reactor should execute successfully

  Scenario: Block security attacks
    Given multiple simultaneous attack vectors
    When security defenses are active
    Then all attacks should be blocked
    And system should remain operational

  Scenario: Achieve 100% OTEL coverage
    Given incomplete metric coverage
    When OTEL bridges are deployed
    Then coverage should reach 100%
    And all metrics should be collected
```
