🚀 ULTRATHINK 80/20 CHANNELHANDLER SWARM DEMONSTRATION
====================================================

Complete implementation using ChannelHandler routing patterns for:
- Sophisticated event routing with pattern matching
- Authentication and authorization plugs
- Stage-specific handlers with delegation
- Real-time notifications across all channels
- BitActor distributed coordination
- Reactor workflow step-by-step execution
- Multi-channel notification permutations

Features implemented:
✅ Phoenix ChannelHandler routing with DSL
✅ Authentication & authorization plugs
✅ Stage-specific event handlers (8 stages)
✅ Real-time step notifications for Reactor workflows
✅ BitActor mesh coordination with message routing
✅ Multi-channel notification broadcasting
✅ Comprehensive error handling and compensation
✅ Kubernetes event streaming
✅ WebSocket real-time UI updates (NO TypeScript)
✅ Permission-based access control
✅ Telemetry and metrics tracking

Pipeline Architecture:
======================

Channel Topic: "pipeline:{pipeline_id}"

Stage Routing:
- ontology:*     → OntologyHandler  (typed ontology creation)
- turtle:*       → TurtleHandler    (TTL generation)
- dspy:*         → DspyHandler      (DSPy conversion)
- bitactor:*     → BitActorHandler  (distributed coordination)
- erlang:*       → ErlangHandler    (OTP generation)
- ash:*          → AshHandler       (resource creation)
- reactor:*      → ReactorHandler   (workflow execution)
- k8s:*          → K8sHandler       (deployment)

Special Routing:
- pipeline:*      → Pipeline control (start/pause/resume/cancel)
- notifications:* → Multi-channel routing
- metrics:*       → Performance monitoring
- error:*         → Error handling and recovery

Notification Channels:
- WebSocket      → Real-time UI updates
- Phoenix PubSub → Internal messaging  
- K8s Events     → Cluster integration
- Webhooks       → External systems
- BitActor Mesh  → Distributed coordination
- GenServer Cast → Process communication
- Nuxt Real-time → Frontend updates (NO TypeScript)

Channel Plugs:
- EnsureAuthenticated    → User validation
- TrackMetrics          → Performance tracking
- ValidatePayload       → Data validation
- CheckPermission       → Authorization
- EnsureDistributed     → Node availability
- CheckActorCapacity    → Resource limits
- ValidateWorkflow      → Workflow validation
- CheckResourceAccess   → Ash resource permissions

Key Innovation: 80/20 Channel Architecture
==========================================

20% Implementation Effort:
- ChannelHandler DSL for elegant routing
- Plug-based middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Event delegation to specialized handlers
- Pattern matching with splat operators

80% Functionality Coverage:
- Complete pipeline stage routing
- Real-time notifications across all channels
- Distributed coordination with BitActor
- Step-by-step workflow execution
- Comprehensive error handling
- Authentication and authorization
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- WebSocket and multi-channel broadcasting

Example Channel Events:
=======================

1. Pipeline Control:
   - "pipeline:start" → Start new pipeline execution
   - "pipeline:pause" → Pause current execution
   - "pipeline:status" → Get current status

2. Ontology Stage:
   - "ontology:create" → Create typed ontology
   - "ontology:validate" → Validate structure
   - "ontology:transform" → Prepare for next stage

3. BitActor Coordination:
   - "bitactor:spawn" → Spawn actor pool
   - "bitactor:coordinate" → Distribute tasks
   - "bitactor:mesh:join" → Join mesh network
   - "actor:coordinator" → Route to coordinator actor

4. Reactor Workflows:
   - "reactor:workflow:create" → Create workflow
   - "reactor:workflow:execute" → Execute with step notifications
   - "reactor:steps:started" → Step started event
   - "reactor:steps:completed" → Step completed event

5. Notifications:
   - "notifications:subscribe" → Subscribe to channels
   - "notifications:channel:websocket" → Route to WebSocket
   - "notifications:channel:k8s" → Route to Kubernetes events

Message Flow Example:
====================

1. Client connects to "pipeline:abc123"
2. Authentication plug validates user
3. Client sends "ontology:create" event
4. Router delegates to OntologyHandler.create/3
5. Handler creates ontology and broadcasts notification
6. NotificationBroadcaster sends to all channels:
   - WebSocket: Real-time UI update
   - PubSub: Internal system notification
   - K8s Events: Cluster event
   - BitActor: Distributed coordination
7. Client receives real-time progress updates
8. Stage completion triggers next stage availability

This demonstrates the complete ULTRATHINK 80/20 channel architecture
with sophisticated routing, real-time notifications, and distributed
coordination - all implemented using ChannelHandler patterns.
