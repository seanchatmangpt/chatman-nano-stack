# AOT Knowledge Compilation Documentation

Ultra-fast validation through ahead-of-time compilation of knowledge specifications to native code.

## Documents

### [📊 AOT Compilation Results](./aot-compilation-results.md)
Performance metrics, architecture overview, and real-world impact of the AOT compilation approach.

### [🔬 Benchmark Analysis](./benchmark-analysis.md)  
Deep dive into the optimization journey from 20 ticks to 1 tick per validation.

### [🛠️ Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md)
Step-by-step guide to using the AOT compilation pipeline for your own specifications.

## Key Highlights

- **1.07 ticks** per validation (0.45 nanoseconds)
- **2.2 billion** validations per second
- **54KB** binary size
- **Zero** runtime dependencies

## Quick Example

Transform this:
```turtle
:Person a owl:Class .
:hasAge rdfs:range xsd:integer .
```

Into this:
```c
// 1 CPU cycle validation
return (g->property_mask & AGE_MASK) != 0;
```

## Why It Matters

Traditional knowledge validation requires heavyweight interpreters, dynamic type checking, and complex graph traversal. This approach compiles all of that away, leaving only the essential validation logic that runs at near-hardware speeds.

Perfect for:
- Real-time systems
- Embedded devices  
- High-frequency trading
- Network packet inspection
- IoT sensor validation
